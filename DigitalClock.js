function clock()
// Define a function named 'clock'

    // Step 1: Create a new Date object representing the current date and time.
    var today = new Date();

    // This gives you a Date object that represents the current moment.

// Step 2: Update the content of an HTML element with the id 'Date'.
// Get the HTML element using document.getElementById('Date').
// Set its innerHTML to a string that combines the day of the week, the name of the month, and the year.

    document.getElementById('Date').innerHTML 
    // Access the day of the week from the dayNames array using today.getDay()//
    = (dayNames[today.getDay()] 
    
    // Concatenate a space and the name of the month from the monthNames array using
    + " " + monthNames[today.getMonth()] + 
     // Concatenate a space and the year from the Date object.
     ' ' + today.getFullYear());

     //Assuming there are arrays dayNames and monthNames defined somewhere in the code,
// this line of code constructs a string and assigns it as the inner HTML of the HTML element with the id 'Date'.


    var h = today.getHours();

       //    var h = today.getHours();: This line extracts the current hours from the Date object (today) and assigns it to the variable h.
    var m = today.getMinutes();
    //var m = today.getMinutes();: This line extracts the current minutes from the Date object and assigns it to the variable m.
    var s = today.getSeconds();
    //var s = today.getSeconds();: This line extracts the current seconds from the Date object and assigns it to the variable s.
    var day = h<11 ? 'AM': 'PM';

    //This line determines whether it's AM or PM based on the extracted hours (h). If the hours are less than 11, it's considered AM; otherwise, it's considered PM. The result is assigned to the variable day


    h = h<10? '0' +h: h;

    //This line checks if the value of h (hours) is less than 10. If it is, it prepends a '0' to it; otherwise, it leaves it unchanged. This ensures that the hours are displayed with two digits, including a leading zero if necessary.

    m = m<10? '0' +m: m;

    // Similarly, this line does the same for minutes (m). It adds a leading zero if the minutes are less than 10.
    s = s<10? '0' +s: s;
    //Likewise, this line does the same for seconds (s).
    //The next three lines update the HTML content of elements with IDs 'hours', 'min', and 'sec' with the formatted values of hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.

    document.getElementById('hours').innerHTML = h;
    //This line selects the HTML element with the ID 'hours' using getElementById('hours'). It then updates the innerHTML property of this element with the value of the variable h. This is a common way to dynamically update the content of an HTML element on a webpage.
    document.getElementById('min').innerHTML = m;
    // Similarly, this line updates the HTML content of the element with ID 'min' with the value of the variable m
    document.getElementById('sec').innerHTML =s;
    //Likewise, this line updates the HTML content of the element with ID 'sec' with the value of the variable s.

} var inter = setInterval(clock,400);
//    This line sets up an interval that repeatedly calls the clock function every 400 milliseconds. This is a way to continuously update the displayed time on a webpage. The clock function likely contains the code you've provided earlier for getting the current time and updating the HTML elements.
